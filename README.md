# Bernard Consulting Task

This app is built on Express/Node in the backend and VueJS on the frontend. It is also using Sequelize ORM to do all the database queries.

## Get started

### Installing

To install the packages and specially NPS, run

```
npm install
```

Once you have NPS installed, you have access to all the other scripts.
Now you can install the client side as well.

```
npm start client.install
```

### Database

The app needs sqlite files to function. Make new files named db.sqlite3 and test.sqlite3 (for testing) in the root directory.
